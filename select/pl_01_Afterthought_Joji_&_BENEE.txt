Lately I've been slippin' away
from you
Can you tell me,
does it hurt today?
Yeah, there's no way, yeah
(No way, no way, no way)
To burn, there's no flames, yeah
(There's no flames)
Prayin' 9 to 5 like a saint,
for you (Like a saint)
Can you tell me how it turned
this way? (How?)
Yeah, things have changed, yeah
(yeah)
Yeah, filled with rage, yeah
(Filled with rage)
So lost in these diamonds,
so lost in this paradise
Don't speed on that highway,
we need you to shine bright
When life gets too complicated,
will you stand with me
after dark
I'll stay in the limelight,
like a beautiful afterthought
Like a beautiful afterthought
Sometimes you'd ask me
for something different
Hated when you did it,
I wish that you didn't
I would do things
and you'd get annoyed, I
Should've never done them,
I wish I was different
Why do we have to step away now?
It's been a year,
been a couple days now
Since you called me,
sayin' you're worried
Been hard for me dealin'
with this space now
No company,
wishin' we could sit down
'Cause I'm sorry,
but you don't want me
So lost in these diamonds,
so lost in this paradise
Don't speed on that highway,
we need you to shine bright
When life gets too complicated,
will you stand with me
after dark
I'll stay in the limelight,
like a beautiful afterthought
Like a beautiful afterthought
I don't wanna forget about you
I don't wanna forget about you
Oh, oh-oh
I don't wanna forget about you
I don't wanna think about it
Think about it
